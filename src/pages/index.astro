            <p>
              Driven by a shared passion and elite football backgrounds, our team combines local insights from the English game with broader European perspectives. Our journey is fueled by the discipline of professional sport and a deep understanding of the modern game.
            </p>
            <p>
              We aren't afraid to start from the ground up. We understand the grit required to climb the ranks and are dedicated to creating a football project that stands for integrity, sustainability, and excellence. For us, starting at the bottom of the pyramid is not a challenge, but a deliberate choice to build on solid foundations.

            <p>
              Our idea is to combine football and social media to tell the real story of a football club: from its creation to its growth, season after season.

            <p>
              London City is not just a team, but a project with a strong identity.
              A club designed to represent London as a whole — not just a single district — and to connect people to the journey, the values, and the ambition behind it.
